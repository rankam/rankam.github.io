          <li><span>The inspiration for recreating Charles Minard's<a href="www.aaronrank.com">Tableaux Graphiques et Cartes Figuratives</a> struck while I read Edward Tufte's The Visual Display of Quantitative Information. Searching the internet, I was unable to find a recreation of the graphic using D3js and I though I would give it a shot. The graphic requires a variety of techniques I thought it would be an excellent way to improve my D3js skills as well as learn more about creating effective graphics.</li>
