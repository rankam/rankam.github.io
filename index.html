          <li><span>Wanting to learn more about D3js and exploratory data analysis (EDA), <a href="simplexa.herokuapp.com/index">Simplex</a> was created as a platform that allows the user to quickly perform basic EDA. Simplex believes that ease of interpreting analysis results is an often overlooked feature in data analysis applications. Simplex aims to make interpreting results easy through providing intuitive explanations and using familiar color indicators in results. Simplex is under development in its alpha stage - check it out <a href="simplexa.herokuapp.com/index">here</a>.</span> </li>

          <li><span>The inspiration for recreating Charles Minard's<a href="www.aaronrank.com">Tableaux Graphiques et Cartes Figuratives</a> struck while I read Edward Tufte's The Visual Display of Quantitative Information. Searching the internet, I was unable to find a recreation of the graphic using D3js and I though I would give it a shot. The graphic requires a variety of techniques I thought it would be an excellent way to improve my D3js skills as well as learn more about creating effective graphics.</span></li>

<h6><a href="#">Machine Learning For Hackers</a></h6>
I am working through various chapters porting the R code into Python. 
<ul>
<li><a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rankam/notebooks/blob/master/Predicting%20Web%20Traffic.ipynb">Chapter 5: Predicting Web Traffic</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rankam/notebooks/blob/master/Optimization%20-%20Breaking%20Codes.ipynb">Chapter 7: Optimization: Code Breaking</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
<h6><a href="#">Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers</a></h6>
I am exploring the Bayesian methods and techniques presented in this book typically by performing an analysis presented in the book on a dataset not used in the book.
<ul>
